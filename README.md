# BuiltWith MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for querying the BuiltWith API to get information about website technology stacks. This server can be used with any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol.

## Features

- **Domain Lookup**: Get detailed information about the technologies used by a specific domain
- **Technology Categorization**: View technologies grouped by categories (Analytics, CMS, Frameworks, etc.)
- **Detailed Information**: Access descriptions, detection dates, and links for each technology

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A BuiltWith API key (get one at [BuiltWith API](https://builtwith.com/api))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cyreslab-AI/builtwith-mcp-server.git
   cd builtwith-mcp-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note:** The MCP SDK is installed directly from GitHub. If you encounter any issues, you may need to update the dependency in package.json to point to the correct repository or version.

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the MCP SDK dependency:

1. Check if the MCP SDK is available in the npm registry:

   ```bash
   npm view @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
   ```

2. If not available, the package.json is configured to use the GitHub repository. If this fails, you may need to:

   - Clone the MCP SDK repository locally
   - Install it as a local dependency:

     ```bash
     # In another directory
     git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/sdk.git
     cd sdk
     npm install
     npm run build

     # Then in your builtwith-mcp-server directory
     npm install --save ../path/to/sdk
     ```

## Configuration

The server requires a BuiltWith API key to function. You can provide this through environment variables when running the server or by adding it to your MCP settings configuration.

### Running Directly

You can run the server directly with the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
BUILTWITH_API_KEY=your-api-key-here node build/index.js
```

### MCP Settings Configuration

Add the server to your MCP client's settings file. The exact location depends on which MCP-compatible AI assistant you're using.

#### Generic MCP Configuration

Most MCP clients follow a similar configuration pattern:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "builtwith": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/builtwith-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BUILTWITH_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude-Specific Configuration

For Claude Desktop:

```json
// ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json (macOS)
// %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json (Windows)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "builtwith": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/builtwith-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BUILTWITH_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Developer Tools:

```json
// ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json (macOS)
// %APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json (Windows)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "builtwith": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/builtwith-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BUILTWITH_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once the server is configured and running, you can use it with any MCP-compatible AI assistant to query website technology stacks.

### Example Queries

With your MCP-compatible AI assistant, you can ask questions like:

- "What technologies does example.com use?"
- "Show me the technology stack for github.com"
- "What analytics tools does amazon.com use?"
- "What frameworks are used by netflix.com?"
- "Is wordpress.com using any e-commerce technologies?"

### Programmatic Usage

For developers who want to integrate directly with the server:

The server communicates using the Model Context Protocol over stdio. You can also use the API client directly in your Node.js applications:

```typescript
import { BuiltWithApiClient } from "./src/api-client.js";

const client = new BuiltWithApiClient({
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
});

const result = await client.getDomainInfo("example.com");
console.log(result);
```

### Available Tools

The server provides the following tools:

#### domain_lookup

Get technology stack information for a specific domain.

Parameters:

- `domain` (required): Domain to analyze (e.g., example.com)
- `detailed` (optional): Whether to return detailed information (boolean)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: Main server entry point
- `src/api-client.ts`: BuiltWith API client
